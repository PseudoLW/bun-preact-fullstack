PLW's Bun/Preact Boilerplate
===
A personal, minimal boilerplate for Bun/Preact project, enabling full stack dev and interaction between client and server.
Just install with `bun install` and you're good to go. Run `src/server/index.ts` to run the server.

IDK Why did I put zod here. Just remove it from dependency if you don't like it.
